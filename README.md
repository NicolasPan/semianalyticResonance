# semianalyticResonance
This python class provides resonance information using semianalytic methods

Only restricted case has been developed yet

The class semianalyticResonance() currently has two methods
  1) hamiltonian(a_width, levels) which plots hamiltonian level curves of the theory
  2) sigmas() which gives equilibrium points
